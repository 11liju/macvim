    <description>MacVim 7.3</description>

    <!--
    To add a new release:

    * add a new <item> below (copy an old one)
    * Adapt the <title>
    * Adapt the <description>
    * Adapt the <pubDate> (format 'Day, dd Mon yyyy hh:mm CET')
    * Adapte <enclosure>, make sure to update the url, length, saprkle:version
      and sparkle:shortVersionString attributes.

    Sparkle honors the following user defaults:

    * SUFeedURL overrides the value in Info.plist (if we want to offer several
      appcasts in the preferences one day ("latest", "stable" for example).

      This means that for testing you can do

          defaults read org.vim.MacVim SUFeedURL  # note this down
          defaults write org.vim.MacVim SUFeedURL file:///Users/you/testcast.xml
            # !!! note the three '/' after 'file:
          # test test test
          defaults write org.vim.MacVim SUFeedURL previousvalue
          # or, to use some default setting for the url,
          defaults delete org.vim.MacVim SUFeedURL

    Sparkle usually assumes a naming scheme of name_versionnumber.tar.bz2 .
    Instead, you can also provide a sparkle:version="2.0_rc2" attribute on
    the enclosure and name the package as you like. You can (and should) also
    provide a sparkle:shortVersionString="User-facing version string"
    attribute that corresponds to CFBundleShortVersionString. Sparkle uses
    CFBundleVersion to determine the current application version.

    Sparkle supports updates in zip, tar, tbz, tgz, or dmg format.

      <description><![CDATA[
<p>This is a minor release of Vim.  It consists of Vim 7.2 plus all
patches, updated runtime files and some more, see below.  It has been
two years since the 7.2 release, thus it's not that "minor".  But not
"major" either.  Something in between, don't know how to call that.</p>.

<p>The most notable additions since 7.2:
  <ul>
    <li> Persistent undo and undo for reload </li>
    <li> Blowfish encryption, encryption of the swap file </li>
    <li> Conceal text </li>
    <li> Lua interface </li>
    <li> Python 3 interface </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Once you have installed Vim 7.3 you can find all the details about the
changes since Vim 7.2 with ":help version-7.3"</p>
